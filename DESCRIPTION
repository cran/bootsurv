Description: Bootstrap resampling methods have been widely studied in the context of survey data. This package implements various bootstrap resampling techniques tailored for survey data, with a focus on stratified simple random sampling and stratified two-stage cluster sampling. It provides tools for precise and consistent bootstrap variance estimation for population totals, means, and quartiles. Additionally, it enables easy generation of bootstrap samples for in-depth analysis.
